## The mission

The **COGIP** is a company which we don't know an all lot about apart that they
produce [Jean-Michel toys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OvPEqQ4KxQ) and that they are [serious workers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wffdzdjuyq0). They also have a incredible [team spirit](https://youtu.be/wywQGe0N96Q?t=6) within their rank.

**Jean-Christian Ranu** works in accounting at the **COGIP**. He has been using an
old, ugly and incomplete software for years, making him go between it and excels
sheet. **Jean-Christian** like paella, crosswords and his coworker **Muriel Perrache**.

So we coded a **web application** which will (we hope) respond to the needs and
desire of **Jean-Christian**.

### Requirements

We will use the [MVC structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) provided in the [PHP MVC Boilerplate](https://github.com/NicolasJamar/php-mvc-boileplate) repo provided by our coach, to help us on our way!
